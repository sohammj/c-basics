ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement: Student Gradebook Management System

You are required to design and implement a Gradebook Management System in C.
This system should help a teacher manage student records, including their marks in multiple subjects, and automatically compute results such as total marks, average, and grade.

âœ… Requirements
	1.	Student Information
	â€¢	Each student record should include:
	â€¢	Roll number (unique)
	â€¢	Name
	â€¢	Marks in 5 subjects
	â€¢	Total marks (calculated)
	â€¢	Average marks (calculated)
	â€¢	Grade (calculated automatically based on average)
	2.	Functionalities
The system should provide the following options in a menu-driven format:
	â€¢	Add Student: Insert a new student record. Roll numbers must be unique.
	â€¢	List Students: Display all student records with details.
	â€¢	Search Student: Search for a student by roll number and display their details.
	â€¢	Update Marks: Modify marks of an existing student.
	â€¢	Delete Student: Remove a student record by roll number.
	â€¢	Save Records to File: Write all student records to a file (gradebook.txt).
	â€¢	Load Records from File: Read all student records from the file.
	â€¢	Exit: End the program after saving the data.
	3.	Grading Criteria
	â€¢	Average â‰¥ 90 â†’ Grade A
	â€¢	Average â‰¥ 75 â†’ Grade B
	â€¢	Average â‰¥ 60 â†’ Grade C
	â€¢	Average â‰¥ 40 â†’ Grade D
	â€¢	Average < 40 â†’ Grade F
	4.	Constraints
	â€¢	Maximum of 100 students can be stored.
	â€¢	Names cannot have spaces (simplification for input).
	â€¢	Data must persist between runs using a text file (gradebook.txt).
